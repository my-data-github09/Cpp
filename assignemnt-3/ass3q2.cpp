// Q2. Imagine a tollbooth at a bridge. Cars passing by the booth are expected to pay a fifty-cent toll.
// Mostly they do, but sometimes a car goes by without paying.
// The tollbooth keeps track of the number of cars that have gone by and of the total amount of money
// collected. Model this tollbooth with a class called tollbooth.
// The two data items are a type unsigned int to hold the total number of cars, and a type double to
// hold the total amount of money collected.
// A constructor initializes all data members to 0. A member function called payingCar() increments
// the car total and adds 0.50 to the cash total. An other function, called nopayCar()
// increments the car total but adds nothing to the cash total. Finally, a member function called
// printOnConsole() displays the two totals and number of paying as well as non paying cars total.
// ( write a menu driven code for it)
